# SSH Key Generator

This project provides a Python-based tool for generating RSA SSH keys and displaying their randomart images. It utilizes Python's `curses` library to manage real-time UI updates in the terminal. This tool is designed to generate a specified number of SSH keys and visualize each key's randomart image, while also displaying key generation statistics.

## Features

- **SSH Key Generation**: Generate RSA keys with a high level of security (RSA 4096 bits).
- **Real-time UI**: Uses `curses` for real-time user interface updates within the terminal.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays time statistics for key generation, including average and most recent key generation times.
- **Batch Generation**

## Prerequisites

Before you run this tool, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `curses` library for Python (usually comes with Python standard library on Unix systems)
- `subprocess` and `os` modules (included in Python standard library)

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ssh-key-generator.git
cd ssh-key-generator
python3 excavator.py
```
